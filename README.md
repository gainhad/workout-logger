# Project Description
*Workout Logger* (Feel free to suggest a better name!) is a mobile-first workout tracking application that I built because I have never found an app that I enjoyed using. I wanted to keep the app simple and fast to use, but also provide a great platform for reviewing workout data in order to track progress.
# Future Plans
Currently, the app is primarily designed for mobile. While it will work on a desktop, the layout is certainly more optimized for a mobile screen. I plan to add a better desktop view for reviewing data though, as that would really take advantage of the extra screen space. I'm pretty happy with the features built in to the workout part of the app, but I would like to continue adding ways to view your data in the future.
# Technology used
## Frontend
- Framework - React (through Create React App) using functional components and React Hooks.
- State Management - Redux
- Style - SCSS, although I would like to move it over to Styled Components or CSS Modules in the future

## Backend
- Language/Runtime - Javascript/NodeJS
- Framework - Express
- Database - Postgresql

## Hosting
Everything is hosted on Google's cloud platform. I am using App Engine to host the application, and Cloud SQL to host the database
